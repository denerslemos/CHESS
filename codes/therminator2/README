-=[ Abstract ]=-

We present an extended version of THERMINATOR, a Monte Carlo event generator
dedicated to studies of the statistical production of particles in relativistic
heavy-ion collisions. The increased functionality of the code contains the
following features: The input of any shape of the freeze-out hypersurface and
the expansion velocity field, including the 3+1 dimensional profiles, in
particular those generated externally with various hydrodynamic codes. The
hypersufraces may have variable thermal parameters, which allows for studies
departing significantly from the mid-rapidity region, where the baryon chemical
potential becomes large. We include a library of standard sets of hypersurfaces
and velocity profiles describing the RHIC Au+Au data at sqrt(s_NN) = 200 GeV
for various centralities, as well as those anticipated for the LHC Pb+Pb
collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 5.5 TeV. A separate code, FEMTO-THERMINATOR, is
provided to carry out the analysis of femtoscopic correlations which are an
important source of information concerning the size and expansion of the system.
We also include several useful scripts that carry out auxiliary tasks, such as
obtaining an estimate of the number of elastic collisions after the freeze-out,
counting of particles flowing back into the fireball and violating causality
(typically very few), or visualizing various results: the particle p_T-spectra,
the elliptic flow coefficients, and the HBT correlation radii. We also
investigate the problem of the back-flow of particles into the hydrodynamic
region, as well as estimate the elastic rescattering in terms of trajectory
crossings.
The package is written in C++ and uses the CERN ROOT environment.

-=[ Downloading source ]=-

THERMINATOR 2 is distributed in a form of a .tar.gz archive containing the
C++ sources, scripts, configuration files, and the data files. The latest
package can be downloaded from the website http://therminator2.ifj.edu.pl/
Prior to compiling and running THERMINATOR 2, the user has to install the
following programs:
 - C++ compiler,
 - ROOT ver. 5.26 or later.
The latest version of the ROOT package is available at http://root.cern.ch/
The simplest way to proceed is to follow the instructions below.

$ mkdir therminator2
$ cd therminator2/
$ wget http://therminator2.ifj.edu.pl/therminator2-latest.tar.gz
$ tar xzf therminator2-latest.tar.gz
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-=[ Compilation ]=-

One compiles THERMINATOR 2 with the command

$ make

The source files of THERMINATOR 2 are documented with  Doxygen to generate the
web-page and the PDF files with detailed information on the classes, variables,
and files. The user must have the Doxygen package installed on the system
The documentation is created with the command

$ make doc
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-=[ Default test run ]=-

A test run is executed with with the script

$ ./runall.sh

This run displays all basic functionality of the package, including the
femtoscopic analysis, producing the plots with the physical results, etc.
It corresponds to Au+Au collisions at the top RHIC energy and centrality 20-30%.
The 2D Boost-Invariant hydrodynamics is used as the input. By default, 5000
events are used. The test run takes several hours to complete (4 h 20 min on
a 3~GHz processor). At the end the events and figures are contained in the
./events/lhyquid2dbi-RHICAuAu200c2030Ti455ti025Tf145/ directory.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-=[ Running ]=-

A step by step sequence performed by the main script runall.sh with default
settings.

[ Generation of events ]
run the script

$ ./runevents.sh

or the binary

$ ./therm2_events
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

[ Figures ]
run the script with all figures

$ ./runfigures.sh

or generate figures one by one

$ root -x './macro/figure_distpt.C("./events/lhyquid2dbi-RHICAuAu200c2030Ti455ti025Tf145/",10)'

The macro figure_distpt.C creates the pT-spectra figure, where the parameter 10
states the number of the event*.root files to be takeen into consideration.

[ Two-particle correlations & HBT radii ]
rut the script to get the calculated correlation function and HBT fit for four
default kT bins.

$./runhbt.sh

or execute the following two binaries for each KT_BIN number (0, 1, 2, 3)

$ ./therm2_hbt 0 ./events/lhyquid2dbi-RHICAuAu200c2030Ti455ti025Tf145/ 10
$ ./therm2_hbtfit ./events/lhyquid2dbi-RHICAuAu200c2030Ti455ti025Tf145/femtopipi0a.root

in this example KT_BIN was equal to 0 and a file femtopipi0a.root was created
and later fitted. The fitting program created a file hbtfitpipi0a.root.
